## Legal

By submitting a Pull Request, you disavow any rights or claims to any changes
submitted to the protein_search project and assign the copyright of
those changes to George McCarthy and Giancarlo Fissore.

This is a legal way of saying "If you submit a PR to us, that code becomes ours".

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (your employment
contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a PR.
Open an issue and someone else can do the work.
